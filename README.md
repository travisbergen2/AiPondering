Gather multiple LLM for group collaboration

How It Works
API Configuration:
Each model’s API endpoint and key are set up in the API_CONFIG dictionary. In practice, you’d replace the placeholder values with real ones.

Querying the Models:
The query_model function sends a prompt to the specified model and awaits the response. Adjustments may be needed to match each API’s request and response format.

Initial Responses:
The gather_initial_responses function sends the question to each model concurrently (using asyncio.gather) and collects their answers.

Critique Phase:
After obtaining the initial answers, gather_critiques constructs a prompt for each model that includes the other models’ responses. Each model is then asked to critique these answers. This second round encourages “cross-review” to identify strengths and weaknesses.

Aggregation:
Finally, aggregate_answers combines all the responses and critiques. In a more advanced implementation, you might incorporate further reasoning (like a weighted voting system or a final summarization step by one of the models) to produce a refined answer.

Implementation Considerations
API Differences:
Each model may require different parameters or endpoint structures. You’ll need to adjust the payload and parsing logic accordingly.

Error Handling:
The code above uses return_exceptions=True with asyncio.gather for simplicity. In a production system, you’d implement robust error checking, retries, and logging.

Security & Rate Limits:
Make sure to secure your API keys, manage rate limits, and handle possible timeouts.

Aggregation Logic:
The simple aggregation shown here can be expanded. For example, you might use one of the models to summarize the critiques into a final answer, or design a scoring system based on the critiques.

This blueprint offers a starting point for building a collaborative system where multiple AI agents “debate” and refine answers to complex questions. The key innovation is orchestrating inter-model critiques to leverage each system’s unique strengths. Enjoy exploring and refining your multi-agent reasoning system!
